## SDRecords

`SDRecords` is an easy way to access data that is stored in data Records on the SD Card.

The format of the data is whatever you decide but for an example let's use that shown below:-

```
struct DataType {`
  `unsigned long Count;`
  `int Bits;`
  `float Volts;`
  `float Amps;`
`};`

`DataType myData;`
`size_t sizeOfDataRecord = sizeof(DataType);`
```

In order to start saving `myData` structures to `SDRecords` we first have to create an exitance of `SDRecords` as below:-

```
SDRecords records;
```

We also need a way to address/recognize our `SDRecords` and they are created from `SDRecortType`s.
The structure of the record type is shown below:-

```
typedef struct SDRecordType {
    File        recordFile;
    size_t      recordSize;
    uint8_t     errCode;
    size_t      errCodeExpansion;
} SDRecordType;
```

Don't forget to include the Library(s) at the head of your code as below:

```
#include <SDRecords.h>			// Mandatory
#include <SDRecordsErrRpt.h>    // Optional, described later
```

When you open a `RecordFile` it creates an SD File. This is stored in `recordFile`. The Record Size is stored in `recordSize` and if an error occurs in any operation then an Error Code will be stored in `errCode`. There may be more information that could help in determining what caused the error and this is stored  in `errCodeExpansion`.

There is one other important way of determining if an error has occurred. A global bool variable exists called `errorOccurred`. Any errors stored in `recordFile.errCode` is local to the function that has just taken place. 

The `bool errorOccurred` on the other hand is global to all `SDRecord` functions and once set is not reset. The only way to reset it is to address it in the main program and set it to false if, for example, the errors have been cleared by the sketch and it is safe to carry on.

Before we can start using `SDRecords` you have to initialize them. The files can be initialised to use the SD library or the SdFat library. 

The command for the SD library is:

   `bool initSD( uint8_t chipSelect );`      It can be used in two forms as either

   `if records.initSD( 10 ) {   // Will initialise SD with chipselect 10`
OR
   `if records.initSD() {		// where the default BUILTIN_SDCARD identifier is used.`

Besides initializing the SD card, `init` also sets the global `errorOccurred` to false.

The functions to initialize the SdFat library are as follows:

    //----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    /** Initialize SD card and file system.
     *
     * \param[in] csPin SD card chip select pin.
     * \param[in] maxSck Maximum SCK frequency.
     * \return true for success or false for failure.
     */
    bool initSDfat(SdCsPin_t csPin, uint32_t maxSck);
    
    //----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    /** Initialize SD card and file system for SPI mode.
     *
     * \param[in] spiConfig SPI configuration.
     * \return true for success or false for failure.
     */
    bool initSDfat(SdSpiConfig spiConfig);
    
    //---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    /** Initialize SD card and file system for SDIO mode.
     *
     * \param[in] sdioConfig SDIO configuration.
     * \return true for success or false for failure.
     */
    bool initSDfat(SdioConfig sdioConfig);

Besides setting `errorOccurred` to false the above SdFat initialization routines just pass the data onto the SdFat library word for word.

Having initialized `SDREcords` we can now create/open a Record File. 

To do that the function `BeginRecords` is used as below:-

```
  SDRecordType myDataRecordFile;

  myDataRecordFile = records.BeginRecords( "DataFile1", sizeOfDataRecord );
```

`BeginRecords` will attempt to open/create a file called "DataFile1" in read/write mode. 

If it is not possible to open/create the file `myDataRecordFile.errCode` will be filled with the error code `Cannot_Open_Record_File`. 

After having created/opened a file `BeginRecords` will check that the file size is compatible with the `RecordSize`. The opened/created file size MUST be divisible by the `RecordSize` with no remainder.

ie n Records will fit exactly within the file size. If the records will not fit exactly 
into the file `myDataRecordFile.errCode` will be set to `File_Size_Does_Not_Match_Records`.

If `BeginRecords` has been successful `myDataRecordFile.errCode` will be set to `NoError`. So to determine if `BeginRecords` has been successful use something like:-

```
   myDataRecordFile = records.BeginRecords( "DataFile1", sizeOfDataRecord );
   if ( myDataRecordFile == NoError ) { //  carry on with the sketch.
```

You could have also checked `errorOccurred`,  just as well as long as you could guarantee that it was false before calling `BeginRecords`. Remember that it is global to all `SDRecords` functions and may already have been set to true, error occurred before the current function was called.

OK, we have opened/created a record file, to save data in the record file we use `WrRecord` as below:_

```
  if ( records.WrRecord( myDataRecordFile, 0, &myData )) {  // do something
```

  `.wrRecords`  returns true if the function was a success. The data supplied to the function is the `SDRecordsFile` type, the number of the record to be written and the data. 

If `.wrRecord` is unsuccessful one of two error codes will be returned in`myDataRecordFile.errcode`. 

They are `Cannot_Seek_to_file_position` OR `Cannot_Write_Record_to_File`.
`myDataRecordFile.errCodeExpansion` will be set to the number of bytes written.

Note that record numbering starts at 0 ( the first record is record 0 ) and that this function does NO checking that the record being written is compatible with the file size. ie if you have a file of 20 records and you attempt to write to record position 30, no checking will be made. That is down to the person writing the sketch.

Reading from `SDRecords` is similar to writing with the format 

```
  if ( records.RdRecord( myDataRecordFile, 10, &myData )) {  // do something
```

In the instance above a record will be read from record position 10.
Potential error codes are again similar: `Cannot_Seek_to_file_position` OR `Cannot_Read_Record_From_File`.

The number of bytes read is stored in `myDataRecordFile.errCodeExpansion.`

After having used the Record Files they are closed with 

```
   records.close( myDataRecordFile );
```

â€‹                             this will attempt to ensure that all the data for the file is flushed to the SD Card.  

Another function which may be useful  is `numberOfRecords` used as below:-

```
  size_t numRecords = records.numberOfRecords( myDataRecordFile );
```

If an error occurs the following `error code File_Size_Does_Not_Match_Records` will be returned in `myDataRecordFile.errCode`. `myDataRecordFile.errCodeExpansion` will hold the size of the data file.



## SDRecordsErrRpt

Whilst developing a sketch it might be useful to have as much error reporting to the screen as possible. That is where this library comes in, it has two functions, `DecodeError` and `PrintRecordInfo`.

Their usage and output is as follows:

`SDRecordsErrRpt.DecodeError( myDataRecordFile );`

The output to the Usb Serial is:

`Err:` followed by one of the following decoded error strings: 

    "No Error"
    "Cannot Open Record File"
    "File Size Does Not Match Records"
    "Cannot Seek to file position"
    "Cannot Write Record to File"
    "Cannot Read Record from File"

AND

`SDRecordsErrRpt.PrintRecordInfo( myDataRecordFile );`

The output to the Usb Serial is:

    "SDRecords Vs     0.6"   // or whaterver the current release is
    "ErrorOccured     True"  // or False
    "recordSize       19"
    "errCode          1"     // 1 is the code for NoError
    "errCodeExpansion 22

You might decide to include `SDRecordsErrRpt` in all your programs, but bear in mind that it  will consume code space.
